## Why Transfer Across Tokenizers?

LLMs are bound to the tokenizer they were pretrained with. This limits their adaptability, reusability and modularity. Tokenizer transfer can lift this limitation. For example:
- If we want to reuse an LLM trained primarily on English in another language, we might want to update its tokenizer to one that is more suitable for the new language.
- If we want to combine (e.g., token-level ensemble) two LLMs, we need to transfer them to a common tokenizer.
- If we want to experiment with better tokenization schemes (e.g., byte-level tokenization), we might want to transfer an existing LLM to this tokenizer instead of training a new one expensively from scratch.
- If we want to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model (which uses another tokenizer), we might want to use *cross-tokenizer distillation* to directly transfer the teacher's knowledge to the student without the need to first transfer the teacher to the student's tokenizer.

This library aims to let you accomplish all of this.

## Installation

`tokenkit` is primarily implemented in Jax, using PyTorch for data loading (so your PyTorch installation does not need to support an accelerator). Recommended installation:

<details>
<summary><strong>TPU</strong></summary>

```bash
# Clone the repository & install the library
git clone https://github.com/bminixhofer/tokenkit

# Create a new virtual environment
# Currently, requires Python <=3.10, but we are working on this: https://github.com/bminixhofer/tokenkit/issues/4
python -m venv tokenkit_env
. tokenkit_env/bin/activate

# Install torch & jax 0.5.0
pip install torch jax[tpu]==0.5.0 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html

# Currently, tokenkit relies on a fork of `lm_eval`
pip install git+https://github.com/bminixhofer/lm-evaluation-harness

# Install the library and the remaining dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
# You can ignore warnings from the command below, see https://github.com/bminixhofer/tokenkit/issues/4
pip install paxml==1.4.0 praxis==1.4.0 --no-deps
```

## Features

### Cross-Tokenizer Distillation

`tokenkit` supports [Approximate Likelihood Matching (ALM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20083) for cross-tokenizer distillation. ALM usually performs best, but we have also implemented the following baselines:

- [Dual Space Knowledge Distillation (DSKD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17328)
- [Universal Logit Distillation (ULD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12030)
- [Minimum Edit Distance Logit Alignment (MinED)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10491)

You can run cross-tokenizer distillation using the [`scripts/cross_tokenizer_distill.py`](scripts/cross_tokenizer_distill.py) script. See [`examples`](examples) for examples on transferring to different subword tokenizers and to byte-level tokenization.

### Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer

`tokenkit` supports Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer (ZeTT) via [Fast Vocabulary Transfer (FVT)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-industry.41). Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer is usually used to obtain a good initialization for additional training, but can in some cases also be useful on its own. See our [ZeTT paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07883) for more details.

You can run Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer using the [`scripts/zett.py`](scripts/zett.py) script.

**🚧 We are working on implementing more ZeTT methods (including hypernetwork training introduced [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07883)).**

### Token-Level Ensembling & Evaluating Transferred Models

`tokenkit` supports autoregressive generation & loglikelihood scoring evaluation by implementing a Jax backend to the [LM Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness). Alongside generating from single models, you can also generate from *token-level ensembles* of models. There are some predefined ensembles in [`configs/models`](configs/models). For example, this evaluates a token-level ensemle of Llama and Qwen on MMLU: 

```bash
python3 scripts/eval_lockstep.py \
  models=llama_qwen \
  eval.tasks=[mmlu]
```

To evaluate pretrained byte-level models, you'll need to pass embeddings to expand the input ids with (i.e., to use as n-gram embeddings). For example:

```bash
python3 scripts/eval.py \
  model.pretrained_model_name_or_path=\'benjamin/Gemma2-2B-IT-Byte\' \
  model.tokenizer_name=\'google/gemma-2-2b-it:source=Gemma2:conversion=byte\' \
  expand_model.pretrained_model_name_or_path=\'benjamin/gemma-2-2b-it-flax\' \
  expand_model.tokenizer_name=\'google/gemma-2-2b-it:source=Gemma2\' \
  eval.tasks=[mmlu]
```

To evaluate any other model (e.g., subword-to-subword transferred models), use something like the following:

```bash
python3 scripts/eval.py \
  model.pretrained_model_name_or_path=\'benjamin/Gemma2-2B-IT-with-Qwen2-Tokenizer\' \
  model.tokenizer_name=\'benjamin/Gemma2-2B-IT-with-Qwen2-Tokenizer:source=Gemma2:conversion=prebyteified\' \
  eval.tasks=[mmlu] \
```
